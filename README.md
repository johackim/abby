## üì¶ Usage

> [!WARNING]
> This script will delete all existing income book entries in Abby and replace them with the synchronized Stripe invoices.

Run the script to synchronize your Stripe invoices with Abby.fr:

```bash
node index.mjs --sync
```

The script performs the following tasks:

- **Deletes all existing income book entries** from Abby.
- **Fetches all paid invoices** from Stripe.
- **Creates new income book entries** in Abby using invoice details such as reference number, client information, date, total amount, and a link to the PDF invoice.

## üîß Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following environment variables:

- **PRODUCT_TYPE**: (Default is `2` representing "Prestations de services")
- **PAYMENT_METHOD**: (Default is `9`, corresponding to "Stripe")

Feel free to fork the project and tailor it to your specific needs.
